This report presents my contributions during my end-of-studies internship at Boston Consulting Group - X Delivery (BCG X), where I developed an innovative intelligent contract management platform leveraging Agentic AI technologies. Conducted as part of my State Engineer diploma in Telecommunications and Information Technology with a specialization in Advanced Software Engineering for Digital Services, the project aimed to automate and optimize traditional, manual-intensive legal workflows.\mynewline

The structured project lifecycle included requirements analysis, benchmarking existing solutions, detailed architectural design, rigorous implementation, and comprehensive validation. Core technologies employed—such as Azure OpenAI, LangChain, LangGraph, Elasticsearch, React, and FastAPI—were specifically chosen for their robustness, scalability, and suitability for secure, AI-driven enterprise legal operations.\mynewline

Throughout this internship, I significantly enhanced my technical and managerial competencies, particularly in navigating complex AI integrations, real-time collaboration, and ensuring stringent security and compliance. Future development of the platform could further leverage predictive analytics, enhanced modularity, strengthened security measures, and continuous user experience optimization, positioning it as a key driver of digital transformation in legal operations.
