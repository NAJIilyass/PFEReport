This report presents my contributions during my end-of-studies internship at Boston Consulting Group - X Delivery (BCG X), where I developed an innovative intelligent contract management platform leveraging Agentic AI technologies. Conducted as part of my State Engineer diploma in Telecommunications and Information Technology with a specialization in Advanced Software Engineering for Digital Services, the project aimed to automate and optimize workflows such as contract drafting, validation, and compliance trackingâ€”common pain points in legal operations due to their repetitive, manual nature.\mynewline

The project addresses the broader challenge of inefficiencies and compliance risks in legal processes, often caused by fragmented communications and regulatory complexity. Motivated by the need for a scalable and intelligent legal solution, the proposed platform leverages Agentic AI to deliver an autonomous and adaptive system capable of reducing risks, improving accuracy, and accelerating contract cycles.\mynewline

In addition to delivering a functional platform, the project enhanced my competencies in AI integration, secure collaboration, and complex system design. Its future evolution could further drive digital transformation in legal operations through predictive analytics, stronger modularity, and continuous user-centric enhancements.
