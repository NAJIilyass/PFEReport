\fancyhead[R]{\textsc{General Introduction}}

In the ever-evolving landscape of cloud computing and virtualization, the need for robust and reliable systems has never been more critical. As organizations increasingly rely on virtual environments to support their operations, ensuring the stability and compatibility of these systems becomes paramount. Oracle Corporation, a global leader in enterprise technology, has been at the forefront of this evolution, providing cutting-edge solutions that empower businesses to leverage virtualization technologies effectively.\\

This report presents a comprehensive overview of my internship project, which focused on validating and testing virtualization modules within the Oracle ecosystem. The project was designed to ensure that core virtualization components, such as QEMU and Libvirt, function seamlessly across various configurations and versions, thereby maintaining the reliability and performance of Oracle Linux and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.\\

The report is structured into four main chapters:

\begin{itemize}
  \item {The First chapter} outlines the project’s context, including an introduction to Oracle Corporation, the team involved, and the objectives of the project;
  \item {The Second chapter} delves into the technical foundations of the project, providing a detailed analysis of the virtualization technologies and tools utilized;
  \item {The Third chapter} discusses the specific tasks and testing procedures undertaken during the internship, highlighting the methodologies used to ensure thorough validation;
  \item {The Fourth chapter} presents the implementation of the tests, detailing the results and the impact on the overall stability and performance of the virtualization environment.
\end{itemize}

This report aims to offer insights into the complexities of virtualization testing and the critical role it plays in the success of Oracle’s enterprise solutions. Through meticulous testing and validation, the project contributed to the ongoing efforts to enhance the reliability and efficiency of Oracle’s virtualization offerings, ensuring that they meet the high standards expected by their customers.
