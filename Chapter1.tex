% Project Framework
\section{Project Framework}

% Agentic AI in Legal Operations
\subsection{Agentic AI in Legal Operations}
Agentic AI refers to a specialized form of Artificial Intelligence designed to autonomously execute tasks and make decisions based on predefined high-level goals, adapting dynamically to changing data and operational contexts. This represents an innovative shift from traditional imperative systems toward more autonomous, goal-oriented decision-making processes. Specifically, in legal operations, Agentic AI significantly improves flexibility, scalability, and efficiency by automating complex workflows traditionally dependent on extensive manual interventions.\mynewline

Within legal applications, Agentic AI provides capabilities such as automated clause selection, intelligent contract data mapping, continuous monitoring, and compliance verification. These autonomous functionalities streamline conventional manual activities involved in contract drafting, validation, and ongoing compliance monitoring, significantly reducing contract processing times while improving accuracy and operational effectiveness.

%Digital Contract Management
\subsection{Digital Contract Management}
The process of contract management traditionally involves manual drafting, iterative feedback loops, and approval workflows that often lead to inefficiencies, errors, and delays. Digital Contract Management (DCM) solutions have emerged to address these issues, aiming to centralize, automate, and optimize the entire lifecycle of contract operations—from initial drafting to final execution and continuous monitoring.\mynewline

DCM employs sophisticated AI-driven agents capable of real-time collaboration, intelligent clause insertion, and automated verification. This approach enhances operational efficiency, reduces manual effort in repetitive tasks, and improves compliance by automatically tracking regulatory changes and adapting contracts accordingly. Digital contract management thus transforms legal operations into agile, scalable, and error-resistant processes, significantly boosting organizational productivity and risk management.

% Need for Intelligent Legal Workflow Systems
\subsection{Need for Intelligent Legal Workflow Systems}
Traditional legal workflows suffer from manual bottlenecks, fragmented processes, and compliance risks due to frequent internal and external regulatory changes. The manual approach limits scalability and visibility, causing significant inefficiencies in managing contractual obligations and deadlines.\mynewline

Implementing Intelligent Legal Workflow Systems, powered by Agentic AI, addresses these pain points by automating repetitive tasks, providing real-time monitoring of contract lifecycles, and offering predictive insights into compliance and risk management. These systems ensure seamless collaboration between various stakeholders, streamline approval processes, and mitigate risks through automated compliance checks. The result is a robust, scalable framework capable of handling complex legal workflows with improved transparency and accountability.

% Problematic
\subsection{Problematic}
Current contract management and legal operations rely heavily on manual inputs, iterative feedback loops, and scattered stakeholder communications, leading to inefficiencies, compliance risks, and delays. Contract drafting and validation processes are especially impacted, often resulting in lengthy negotiation cycles, limited visibility into contract deadlines, and difficulty in ensuring consistent regulatory compliance across different jurisdictions. The lack of automated systems further exacerbates these issues, causing increased operational costs and elevated risk profiles.

% Objectives
\subsection{Objectives}
This project aims to deploy and evaluate the effectiveness of an AI-driven intelligent contract management platform leveraging Agentic AI to transform traditional legal operations into streamlined, scalable, and automated processes.\mynewline

The specific objectives include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Automating repetitive and manual contract drafting tasks through AI pre-filling and intelligent clause selection.
    \item Establishing real-time, AI-driven monitoring and compliance validation of contracts.
    \item Enhancing collaboration and efficiency across multiple stakeholders via automated workflows and digital signatures.
    \item Reducing overall contract processing time and manual effort significantly (40-60\% reduction target).
    \item Minimizing compliance risks through automated regulatory updates and monitoring, aiming for a 30\% risk reduction.
\end{itemize}

Achieving these goals will provide a standardized, scalable solution capable of significantly enhancing efficiency, compliance, and risk management across legal operations.

% Project Management
\section{Project Management}
The project management approach employed during my internship was meticulously structured to ensure smooth execution and timely delivery. Our methodology was grounded in Agile principles, specifically utilizing the Scrum framework to manage the iterative development and deployment of the intelligent contract management platform.

% Scrum Methodology
\subsection{Scrum Methodology}
Scrum is an Agile project management framework designed to facilitate iterative progress through collaboration, flexibility, and responsiveness to feedback. This methodology was particularly suitable for our project due to the dynamic and innovative nature of AI-driven platform development.
