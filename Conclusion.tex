This report has detailed the design and development of an AI-powered intelligent contract management platform, carried out during my internship at BCG X. The project addresses a key challenge in legal operations: the inefficiency, inconsistency, and compliance risks associated with manual contract workflows, particularly in drafting, validation, and approval processes. These workflows are time-consuming, prone to error, and difficult to standardize across teams.\mynewline

To respond to this challenge, the developed platform offers an end-to-end solution that supports contract generation from dynamic templates, variable insertion, clause request management, collaborative editing, and legal review. Built with modular components and integrated AI agents, the platform automates critical tasks while maintaining traceability and legal rigor. It also introduces AI-driven features such as clause refinement, compliance checks using LLMs, and structured document modeling aligned with legal conventions.\mynewline

Technologies used include Azure OpenAI, LangChain, LangGraph, FastAPI, React, and Elasticsearch, enabling scalable integration of autonomous AI agents and robust backend logic. The platform demonstrates how Agentic AI can transform traditional legal processes into structured, efficient, and adaptive workflowsâ€”reducing cycle time, improving accuracy, and supporting enterprise-level collaboration in a secure environment.\mynewline

This experience allowed me to apply and enhance my skills in software architecture, AI integration, and secure systems engineering. Looking ahead, the platform could evolve through predictive clause analytics, stronger modularity, and customizable user interfaces. These advancements would further position the platform as a critical enabler of digital transformation within legal departments and beyond.
