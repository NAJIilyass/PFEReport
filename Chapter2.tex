\section{Technical Background}

%% Virtualization
\subsection{Virtualization}
Virtualization serves as a cornerstone technology in modern IT infrastructure, enabling a single physical machine, or VM Host Server, to run multiple operating systems simultaneously as virtual machines (VM Guests). This approach abstracts the underlying hardware resources, creating isolated environments where each operating system can function independently, as though it were on dedicated hardware.

%% Mechanisms of Virtualization
\subsubsection[Mechanisms of Virtualization]{Mechanisms of Virtualization}
The critical enabler of virtualization is the hypervisor, a software layer that directly interfaces with the hardware of the VM Host Server. The hypervisor manages the allocation of resources such as CPU, memory, and storage, distributing them among the various VM Guests. By presenting each guest with a virtualized hardware interface, the hypervisor ensures that multiple operating systems can coexist without interference. There are two primary types of hypervisors utilized in enterprise environments: Type 1 (bare-metal hypervisors) and Type 2 (hosted hypervisors).

%% Advantages of Virtualization in Cloud Infrastructure
\subsubsection[Advantages of Virtualization in Cloud Infrastructure]{Advantages of Virtualization in Cloud Infrastructure}
In the context of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), virtualization provides several strategic advantages:\mynewline
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cost Optimization:} Virtualization reduces the need for additional hardware by allowing multiple operating systems to run on a single physical server, leading to significant savings in hardware, power, and cooling costs;
    \item \textbf{Enhanced Resource Utilization:} By maximizing the use of available resources, virtualization helps ensure that CPU, memory, and storage are used efficiently, reducing waste and improving overall system performance;
    \item \textbf{Operational Flexibility:} Virtualization facilitates rapid provisioning and deployment of virtual machines, enabling IT teams to quickly respond to changing business needs. Features such as live migration and snapshots further enhance the flexibility and resilience of virtualized environments;
    \item \textbf{Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity:} Virtualization supports advanced disaster recovery strategies by enabling features like VM snapshots, live migration, and automated failover, which are critical for maintaining business continuity in the event of hardware failures or other disruptions.
\end{itemize}

%% Virtualization Modes
\subsubsection[Virtualization Modes]{Virtualization Modes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Full Virtualization:} This mode emulates complete hardware, allowing unmodified operating systems to run in a virtualized environment. It is particularly useful when running legacy applications that require full emulation of underlying hardware;
    \item \textbf{Paravirtualization:} In this mode, the guest operating system is modified to interact directly with the hypervisor, leading to improved performance. Paravirtualization is advantageous in scenarios where high efficiency and performance are required;
    \item \textbf{Hardware-Assisted Virtualization (HVM):} This mode leverages hardware features such as Intel VT-x and AMD-V to enhance virtualization performance. HVM combines the compatibility of full virtualization with the efficiency of paravirtualization, making it ideal for high-performance computing environments.
\end{itemize}


%% Oracle Linux
\subsection{Oracle Linux}
Oracle Linux, often abbreviated as OL (previously known as Oracle Enterprise Linux or OEL), is a robust and versatile Linux distribution developed and freely distributed by Oracle Corporation. Since its initial release in 2006, Oracle Linux has been partially licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), making it an open-source platform. It is built using the source code from Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), with Oracle replacing Red Hat's branding with its own. This distribution plays a significant role in Oracle's ecosystem, serving as the foundation for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and Oracle Engineered Systems, including Oracle Exadata.
