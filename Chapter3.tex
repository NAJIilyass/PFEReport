%% Architecture of the Solution
\section{Solution's Architecture}

% Overall Architecture
\subsection{Overall Architecture}
\begin{center}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Images/Global Architecture of the Platform.png}
    \captionof{figure}{Overall Architecture of the Platform}
    \label{fig:overall_architecture}
\end{center}

The overall architecture of the platform, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:overall_architecture}, depicts a structured interaction between users, frontend interfaces, backend services, databases, and AI-driven components. Users interact with the platform primarily through the web application frontend. Depending on the access requirements, users may need to authenticate via an external Single Sign-On (SSO) service to securely access private functionalities or can directly access public features like shared links through URL-based token authentication.\mynewline

The frontend communicates with the backend services built using the FastAPI framework, where the core business logic resides. This backend interacts extensively with a PostgreSQL database to persist logs and manage structured data efficiently. Elasticsearch is implemented as a vector database responsible for similarity searches, enhancing the platform’s data retrieval capabilities.\mynewline

Interaction with various Large Language Models (LLMs)—including Azure OpenAI, OpenAI GPT-4.1, and Anthropic—is managed via the LangChain framework, abstracting and simplifying communications and integration. LangGraph extends LangChain’s capabilities, facilitating the execution of complex, graph-based AI agent workflows, thereby enabling more dynamic interactions and decision-making processes within the platform.\mynewline

For observability and monitoring purposes, the system integrates Langfuse. Langfuse provides comprehensive tracking of all interactions with LLM APIs, including essential metrics such as API response times, token usage, and associated costs. This observability ensures robust management and operational transparency of the AI services integrated within the platform.

% Logical Architecture
\subsection{Logical Architecture}
This section presents the internal structure of the application codebase. Given that the core mission focused on the implementation of new features across both the backend service and frontend, the focus here will be on the logical design of these two key components.

% Main Backend Service
\subsubsection{Main Backend Service}
In the FastAPI-based backend, we adopted a layered modular architecture for each functional domain. As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:backend_module_architecture}, each module is composed of a controller responsible for managing HTTP and WebSocket requests, which communicates with a service layer that encapsulates the business logic. The service interacts with the data models and relies on DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for structured data exchanges across layers.\mynewline

To abstract and streamline access to persistent storage, a DAO (Data Access Object) pattern is implemented. The DAO interfaces with a dedicated Data Service layer that encapsulates direct database operations. This clear separation of responsibilities ensures high maintainability, testability, and scalability. It also allows for improved consistency in query logic and facilitates secure data access patterns.\mynewline

This architecture was particularly beneficial for implementing legal use cases and AI-enhanced features, where the backend needed to efficiently orchestrate data retrieval, validation, and transformation between internal components and the frontend interface.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{Images/Layered Architecture of a Backend Module.png}
    \captionof{figure}{Layered Architecture of a Backend Module}
    \label{fig:backend_module_architecture}
\end{center}

% Frontend Structure
\subsubsection{Frontend Structure}
On the frontend side, we implemented a modular structure grounded in the principles of separation of concerns and component reusability. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:frontend_module_architecture}, each module consists of components responsible for managing the user interface and interactions, and services that encapsulate domain-specific business logic and handle communication with the backend via HTTP or WebSocket, depending on the context.\mynewline

The architecture also integrates a dedicated store layer to manage state, especially for dynamic content and session-persistent interactions. DTOs are used to structure and validate data exchanged with the backend, while models represent the internal structure of application entities.\mynewline

This modular organization promotes code maintainability and scalability, enabling independent development and testing of each module. It also facilitates a smooth integration of new features such as AI-based clause recommendations and real-time collaboration within the contract editor.

    \captionof{figure}{Component Architecture of a Frontend Module}
    \label{fig:frontend_module_architecture}
\end{center}

% LLM Integration
\subsection{LLM Integration}
Integration of LLMs within the platform is streamlined using the LangChain framework, which provides an abstraction layer to interact uniformly with multiple LLM providers. As depicted in Figure \ref{fig:llm_integration}, this integration allows the platform to remain flexible, accommodating advancements in LLM technologies with minimal architectural adjustments.\mynewline

\begin{center}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{Images/LLM Integration.png}
    \captionof{figure}{LLM Integration via LangChain}
    \label{fig:llm_integration}
\end{center}

LangChain efficiently manages the interaction between the platform and various LLM services, handling data flow optimization, API call management, input/output formatting, and robust error handling mechanisms. It also incorporates rate-limiting functionalities to ensure resource-efficient and cost-effective interactions.


% Text Editing Framework: Tiptap
\subsection{Text Editing Framework: Tiptap}
On the frontend, the platform employs the Tiptap editor—an open-source, third-party framework built on top of ProseMirror and designed to provide extensible rich-text editing capabilities, especially within modern React-based applications. Tiptap is integrated as a ready-to-use library rather than being developed in-house, and its adoption ensures robust and reliable document editing features aligned with best practices in frontend architecture.\mynewline

Within the platform, Tiptap has been tailored specifically for the structured editing of legal documents such as contracts. Unlike traditional rich-text editors, Tiptap is configured to meet the complex formatting and regulatory requirements intrinsic to legal documents. Users can efficiently organize document elements into legally defined sections, clauses, and subsections.\mynewline

Tiptap supports critical legal editing features, including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Structured Document Editing}: Customized nodes and marks for legally compliant structural elements, allowing users to efficiently manage and format contracts according to legal and organizational standards.
    \item \textbf{Clause and Variable Management}: Specialized nodes for inserting, editing, and managing clauses and dynamic contract variables directly within the document, ensuring precision and consistency.
    \item \textbf{Real-time Collaborative Editing}: Integration with collaborative technologies such as Y.js enables multiple legal professionals and stakeholders to simultaneously edit, review, and approve documents, reflecting changes in real-time and maintaining a clear audit trail of modifications.
\end{itemize}

This tailored configuration of Tiptap significantly enhances the user experience, providing a robust, intuitive interface optimized specifically for drafting, reviewing, and finalizing complex legal contracts, while leveraging an established and actively maintained framework from the open-source ecosystem.

\end{center}

% Detailed Design
\section{Detailed Design}

% Class Diagram
\subsection{Class Diagram}
The class diagram is a fundamental UML diagram type that illustrates the static structure of the software system, detailing its classes, their attributes, methods, and the relationships among these classes. Figure \ref{fig:class_diagram} presents the comprehensive class diagram of the intelligent contract management platform developed during this internship.

\begin{landscape}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.2\textwidth]{Images/Class Diagram.png}
    \caption{Class Diagram of The Platform}
    \label{fig:class_diagram}
\end{figure}
\end{landscape}

All classes in this architecture inherit from the \textbf{CustomBase}, providing universal attributes such as a unique identifier (\textit{id}), timestamps for creation, update, and deletion of entries.\mynewline

The \textbf{User} class represents users of the platform, associating each user with specific \textbf{Roles} (e.g., Sales or Legal), which determine a set of \textbf{Permissions} defining accessible functionalities.\mynewline

The \textbf{Contract} class represents an agreement between a company and its client, distinct from the platform users. Each contract is associated with a specific \textbf{Client}, and relies on a \textbf{ContractTemplate} based on a combination of product, contract type, and Incoterm. Contracts can also originate by cloning existing contracts.\mynewline

Contracts feature five distinct statuses represented by the enumeration \textit{ContractStatusEnum}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{IN\_EDIT}: Initial stage, editable by both Sales and Legal teams.
    \item \textbf{IN\_REVIEW}: Editable by Legal, but frozen for Sales, acting as a proxy to finalization.
    \item \textbf{FINALIZED}: Fully reviewed and locked from editing by both teams.
    \item \textbf{SIGNED}: Confirmed and mutually agreed upon by the company and the client.
    \item \textbf{ARCHIVED}: Used for historical purposes based on the company's archiving policies.
\end{itemize}

Each \textbf{Contract} is composed of one or multiple \textbf{ContractVersions} to manage iterative changes and improvements. Versions include structured \textbf{Sections}, each comprising multiple fields detailed by \textbf{ContractField} classes representing variables specific to each contract section.\mynewline

The \textbf{ClauseRequest} class is specifically dedicated to handling clause modification requests made by Sales users to the Legal team, marked by statuses within the \textit{ClauseRequestStatusEnum} (\textit{SAVED}, \textit{SENT}, \textit{DONE}, \textit{REJECTED}). Requests transition from \textit{SAVED} when initially drafted by a Sales user, to \textit{SENT} upon submission to Legal. Depending on the decision by Legal, these requests become \textit{DONE} upon acceptance and implementation, or \textit{REJECTED} if not approved.\mynewline

This class diagram provides a clear and structured representation, highlighting crucial entities, their interrelations, and functionalities integral to the platform’s effective management of digital contract operations.


% Detailed Sequence Diagram
\subsection{Detailed Sequence Diagram}
Following the analysis phase where chronological interactions between the system and actors were outlined, detailed sequence diagrams have been created. These diagrams precisely illustrate interactions among system components to realize specific use cases. The use cases chosen for detailed representation are \textbf{Generate a New Contract}, \textbf{Create Clause Request} and \textbf{Review Clause Request}.

% Generate a New Contract
\subsubsection{Generate a New Contract}

\begin{center}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Images/Sequence Diagram - Draft Contract.png}
    \captionof{figure}{Sequence Diagram - Draft Contract}
    \label{fig:sequence_diagram_draft_contract}
\end{center}

To maintain clarity and reduce complexity, certain subprocesses—such as Create Client and Create Contract Version—are encapsulated within ref frames. The detailed sequence diagrams for these referenced interactions are provided in the following figures:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering

    \begin{minipage}[t]{0.48\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Images/Sequence Diagram - Create Client Ref.png}
        \captionof{figure}{Sequence Diagram – Create Client}
        \label{fig:sequence_diagram_create_client}
    \end{minipage}
    \hfill
    \begin{minipage}[t]{0.48\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Images/Sequence Diagram - Create Contract Version Ref.png}
        \captionof{figure}{Sequence Diagram – Create Contract Version}
        \label{fig:sequence_diagram_create_contract_version}
    \end{minipage}

    \vspace{0.5cm}

    \begin{minipage}[t]{0.48\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Images/Sequence Diagram - Create Sections Ref.png}
        \captionof{figure}{Sequence Diagram – Create Contract Sections}
        \label{fig:sequence_diagram_create_sections}
    \end{minipage}
    \hfill
    \begin{minipage}[t]{0.48\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Images/Sequence Diagram - Create Dynamic Fields Ref.png}
        \captionof{figure}{Sequence Diagram – Create Dynamic Fields}
        \label{fig:sequence_diagram_create_dynamic_fields}
    \end{minipage}

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:sequence_diagram_draft_contract} depicts the detailed sequence diagram for generating a new contract. In this scenario, the sales user initiates by logging into the system and providing a prompt through text, voice, or image, detailing essential information needed for the contract. The system then extracts necessary fields such as Incoterm, contract type, product, and client name to identify the appropriate template and client data. If critical information is missing or a new client is identified, the system prompts the user for clarification or confirmation to avoid mismatches.\mynewline

Upon confirmation, the system creates a new client record if necessary, extracts dynamic fields from the provided prompt, selects the appropriate contract template, and populates the dynamic fields accordingly. Missing fields are filled either by referencing a specific past contract indicated by the user or by defaulting to the client's most recent contract. If the client is new or no relevant contracts are found, fields remain empty. After contract generation, the user is automatically redirected to the contract editing interface.

% Clause Request Lifecycle
\subsubsection{Clause Request Lifecycle}

The Clause Request Lifecycle involves coordinated interactions between sales and legal teams, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:sequence_diagram_clause_request_sales} and Figure \ref{fig:sequence_diagram_clause_request_legal}. Initially, a sales user creates a clause request by providing a description for modifying, adding, or deleting clauses within a contract. The user can optionally refine this description with assistance from the Refiner Agent, which leverages an LLM to enhance clarity and precision. The sales user can then either save the request for later or send it directly to the legal team.\mynewline

Upon submission, the legal team receives a notification of the new clause request. Legal users may reject the request immediately by providing specific feedback or accept it for further processing. Accepted requests prompt legal users to utilize a dedicated editor to craft or modify clauses as requested. Completed clauses may be directly integrated into the active contract by publishing, or saved in the clause library for future use.

\begin{landscape}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.1\textwidth]{Images/Sequence Diagram - Sales - Clause Request.png}
    \caption{Sequence Diagram - Clause Request (Sales Perspective)}
    \label{fig:sequence_diagram_clause_request_sales}

    \captionof{figure}{Sequence Diagram - Refine Text}
    \label{fig:sequence_diagram_refine_text}
\end{center}

After presenting the clause request process from the Sales user's perspective, the following sequence diagram illustrates the corresponding workflow from the Legal user's point of view:

\begin{landscape}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.3\textwidth]{Images/Sequence Diagram - Legal - Clause Request.png}
    \caption{Sequence Diagram - Clause Request (Legal Perspective)}
    \label{fig:sequence_diagram_clause_request_legal}
\end{figure}
\end{landscape}

\begin{center}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{Images/Sequence Diagram - Update Sections Ref.png}
    \captionof{figure}{Sequence Diagram - Update Contract Sections}
    \label{fig:sequence_diagram_update_contract_sections}
\end{center}

These diagrams comprehensively clarify the interactions between system components, highlighting critical processes and dependencies to ensure a smooth and efficient workflow within the intelligent contract management platform.

% Deployment Architecture
\section{Deployment Architecture}
The deployment architecture is a core operational layer that supports the delivery, testing, and maintenance of the intelligent contract management platform. It enables rapid feature iteration, automated quality control, and consistent deployment across environments. This section outlines how DevOps practices—particularly Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)—are integrated into the project’s delivery lifecycle.

\begin{center}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Images/Deployment Architecture.png}
    \captionof{figure}{Deployment Architecture Overview}
    \label{fig:deployment_architecture}
\end{center}

The process begins with developers managing tasks via Azure Boards and committing changes to a Git repository. Each push triggers a CI pipeline configured to perform essential validations, including static code analysis using SonarCloud, unit testing, and artifact building. Secrets required during builds are retrieved securely from Azure Key Vault, and integration tests are executed within isolated environments to ensure stability.\mynewline

After successful validation, build artifacts are promoted to the CD pipeline, where IaC (Infrastructure-as-Code) tools such as Terraform and Helm are used to deploy services to Kubernetes clusters across development and production environments. Docker images are stored in Azure Container Registry, enabling versioned and reproducible deployments. These workflows ensure high confidence in new releases and accelerate the delivery of new features while maintaining system reliability and traceability.
